          <p>Hello and welcome to this corner of the web!  My name is Grant, I'm a mid-30s guy who transplanted to Austin 10 years ago now.  Through a series of events, here I am and I am making a website and I am literally twice as older as I was when I last made websites.  This is a class assignment so this is not going to be professional at all in the slightest.  I want to have fun with this!  Here are some lists of things that I like, or think about, so this paragraph will change to hang with the times.
