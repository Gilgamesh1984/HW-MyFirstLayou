          <p>Hello and welcome to this corner of the web!  My name is Grant, I'm a mid-30s guy who transplanted to Austin 10 years ago now.  Through a series of events, here I am and I am making a website and I am literally twice as older as I was when I last made websites.  This is a class assignment so this is not going to be professional at all in the slightest.  I want to have fun with this!  Here are some lists of things that I like, or think about, so this paragraph will change to hang with the times.

    <h3>My Favorite Poem</h3>
    <h3>O Me! O Life!</h3>
      <p>BY WALT WHITMAN<br>
      Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,<br>
      Of the endless trains of the faithless, <br>of cities fill’d with the foolish,<br>
      Of myself forever reproaching myself, <br>(for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)<br>
      Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,<br>
      Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,<br>
      Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,<br>
      The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these,<br> O me, O life?<br>
      
                                             <em><br>Answer.<br></em>
      That you are here—that life exists and identity,<br>
      That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.<br></p>
